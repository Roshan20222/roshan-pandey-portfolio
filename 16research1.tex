\begin{abstract}
Getting state-of-the-art video segmentation models to run on edge devices like smartphones and drones remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While models like SAM2 deliver impressive results, they require powerful GPUs and consume substantial energy, making them impractical for resource-constrained devices. We present \model, a family of lightweight video segmentation models designed specifically for real-time inference on edge hardware through memory-aware knowledge distillation.

Our approach is built on three key innovations. First, we introduce memory-aware distillation that teaches the student model not just to match the teacher's outputs, but to replicate its temporal reasoning by matching attention distributions and memory readouts. Second, we develop a learned memory pruning mechanism that intelligently selects which frame features to retain within strict device memory budgets. Third, we implement an adaptive inference system that dynamically adjusts resolution and memory usage based on real-time device performance.

Trained on YouTube-VOS, DAVIS, and other video datasets, \model\ achieves 83.1\% J\&F score on DAVIS 2017 (96\% of SAM2's performance) while operating 6.5× faster with 48× fewer parameters. On NVIDIA Jetson edge devices, it processes frames in 20-35 milliseconds and consumes less than 1.3 watt-hours of energy for a 10-minute video, enabling hours of continuous operation on battery power. We release all code, trained models, and deployment tools at \url{https://github.com/your-repo-here}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Video object segmentation (VOS)---the task of identifying and tracking objects across video frames---has seen remarkable progress with recent models like SAM2~\cite{ravi2024sam2} achieving unprecedented accuracy. However, these models are designed for cloud servers with powerful GPUs, not for deployment on edge devices. This creates a fundamental disconnect between where AI capabilities exist and where they're actually needed.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{\textbf{Overview of SAM2-Lite.} We distill SAM2's video segmentation capabilities into compact models suitable for edge devices.

\end{figure}

Consider applications that require on-device video understanding: privacy-preserving medical imaging where patient data cannot leave the device, autonomous robotics requiring sub-100ms response times, battery-powered drones with limited energy budgets, or field research in areas without internet connectivity. For all these scenarios, sending video to the cloud for processing is either impossible, impractical, or undesirable.

Existing approaches to model compression---pruning, quantization, and standard knowledge distillation---fall short for video segmentation. The challenge lies in the temporal dimension: video models must maintain consistent object representations across hundreds of frames while operating under strict memory constraints. Simply making a model smaller doesn't teach it how to efficiently manage temporal memory.

\subsection{Our Contributions}

We introduce \model, which enables SAM2-quality video segmentation on edge devices through three interconnected technical contributions:

\paragraph{Memory-Aware Knowledge Distillation (Section~\ref{sec:mem-distill})}
Beyond matching output masks, we teach the student model to replicate the teacher's temporal reasoning. We explicitly match: (1) cross-attention distributions over past frames, showing which historical information matters, and (2) memory readout features, capturing what information gets extracted. This yields models that reason about temporal context similarly to the teacher, improving long-term tracking stability.

\paragraph{Learned Memory Pruning with Budget Constraints (Section~\ref{sec:pruning})}
Edge devices cannot store features from hundreds of past frames. We train a compact gating network that scores memory token importance based on visual features, motion magnitude, prediction uncertainty, and temporal distance. Using differentiable top-k selection, the model learns to fit within device memory budgets (e.g., 256-512 tokens) while preserving the most informative temporal context.

\paragraph{Runtime-Adaptive Inference (Section~\ref{sec:adaptive})}
Device capabilities vary dramatically, and even identical devices experience performance fluctuations. We implement a PID controller that monitors frame processing time and dynamically adjusts input resolution (0.5×--1.0×) and memory window size (2-8 frames) to maintain target frame rates, ensuring smooth real-time operation across diverse hardware.

\subsection{Key Results}

Our experiments (Section~\ref{sec:experiments}) demonstrate that \model\ achieves the following:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt,topsep=2pt]
\item \textbf{Accuracy:} 83.1\% J\&F on DAVIS 2017, reaching 96\% of SAM2's performance with our medium-sized variant
\item \textbf{Efficiency:} 6.5× faster inference and 12× lower energy consumption compared to SAM2
\item \textbf{Edge Performance:} Real-time operation (20-35 ms/frame) on Jetson devices and modern smartphones
\item \textbf{Stability:} Superior long-term tracking compared to FIFO and other memory management baselines
\item \textbf{Scalability:} Three model variants (Tiny/Small/Base) spanning different accuracy-efficiency trade-offs
\end{itemize}

By releasing our models and tools, we aim to democratize real-time video segmentation, enabling privacy-preserving, low-latency, and energy-efficient applications on edge devices.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Video Object Segmentation}

Semi-supervised VOS has evolved from early memory network approaches~\cite{oh2019stm} to sophisticated architectures. STM~\cite{oh2019stm} pioneered memory banks for temporal matching, but required hand-crafted pruning heuristics. STCN~\cite{cheng2021stcn} improved efficiency through correspondence learning. XMem~\cite{cheng2022xmem} introduced dual memory (sensory and working memory) achieving strong results with ~80M parameters. AOT~\cite{yang2021aot} and DeAOT~\cite{yang2022deaot} use hierarchical identification for multi-object scenarios, with DeAOT-Small at ~40M parameters.

While these methods achieve excellent accuracy, they weren't designed for edge deployment. They assume GPU availability and don't address runtime adaptation to device constraints. Our work explicitly targets edge devices with bounded memory and computational budgets.

\subsection{Segment Anything Models}

SAM~\cite{kirillov2023sam} revolutionized image segmentation through large-scale pretraining on 1B masks. SAM2~\cite{ravi2024sam2} extended this to video via streaming architecture with temporal memory, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, its ViT-Huge backbone (600M+ parameters) runs at just 8-10 FPS on A100 GPUs, making edge deployment infeasible.

Efforts to compress SAM for images include MobileSAM~\cite{zhang2023mobilesam} (coupled distillation to ~10M parameters) and FastSAM~\cite{zhao2023fastsam} (YOLO-based approach). However, these target image segmentation only and don't handle video's temporal memory requirements. To our knowledge, \model\ is the first systematic effort to distill SAM2 for streaming video on edge devices with explicit memory management.

\subsection{Knowledge Distillation for Video}

Knowledge distillation~\cite{hinton2015distilling} has proven effective for model compression across domains. For video understanding, most work targets action recognition~\cite{zhang2019distilling} or detection, typically distilling spatial features or final predictions.

Recent advances explore distilling temporal representations~\cite{li2020temporal}, but don't explicitly target attention mechanisms or memory states. Our memory-aware distillation is inspired by attention transfer~\cite{zagoruyko2017attention} but extends it to the temporal domain, specifically matching cross-attention distributions and memory readouts---crucial for video models.

\subsection{Adaptive Computation and Pruning}

Dynamic neural networks that adjust computation per sample have gained traction~\cite{han2021dynamic}. Token pruning in vision transformers~\cite{rao2021dynamicvit} drops uninformative tokens to accelerate inference. AdaViT~\cite{meng2022adavit} adjusts depth based on input difficulty.

For video, some methods use learned frame sampling~\cite{korbar2019scsampler} or adaptive pooling. However, these focus on computational efficiency rather than explicit memory constraints. Our learned pruning differs by respecting hard device memory budgets while maintaining temporal coherence---essential for stable long-term tracking.

\subsection{Edge Deployment and Quantization}

Deploying neural networks on edge devices requires quantization. QAT~\cite{jacob2018quantization} simulates low precision during training. TensorRT~\cite{tensorrt} provides optimized INT8 kernels for NVIDIA hardware, while ONNX Runtime enables cross-platform deployment.

We leverage these tools but face unique challenges with dynamic memory operations. Our solution uses mixed precision: INT8 for most layers, FP16 for attention where numerical stability matters, and custom TensorRT plugins for memory operations.

\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure*}

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} illustrates our approach. We design a compact student architecture, train it to replicate SAM2's temporal reasoning through memory-aware distillation, and enforce strict memory budgets through learned pruning.

\subsection{Student Architecture}

The student model comprises three components:

\paragraph{Lightweight Vision Encoder}
We employ Vision Transformer~\cite{dosovitskiy2021vit} variants (ViT-Tiny/Small/Base) as frame encoders, processing images at 16×16 patch granularity. Unlike SAM2's ViT-Huge (632M parameters), our largest encoder has just 86M parameters. We experimented with CNNs (ResNet~\cite{he2016resnet}, EfficientNet~\cite{tan2019efficientnet}) but found ViTs provide better accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for our use case.

\paragraph{Bounded Memory Bank}
We maintain key-value pairs $(K, V)$ from past frames for temporal reasoning. Critically, we enforce a strict budget $B$ (typically 256-512 tokens) matching device RAM constraints. Each memory token stores a 256-dimensional vector, consuming ~1KB. The gating mechanism (Section~\ref{sec:pruning}) selects which tokens to retain.

\paragraph{Compact Cross-Attention Decoder}
Our decoder uses 3 transformer layers (vs. 8 in SAM2) with cross-attention over the memory bank. We employ DETR-style~\cite{carion2020detr} object queries but reduce dimensionality (256 vs. 512) and query count (100 vs. 256) for efficiency. The decoder outputs segmentation masks via a small CNN head.

\subsection{Memory-Aware Distillation}
\label{sec:mem-distill}

Standard distillation minimizes output differences:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{naive}} = \|\text{mask}^S - \text{mask}^T\|^2.
\end{equation}

This ignores \emph{how} the model reasons temporally. The teacher might correctly segment an object by attending to frames 5 and 20, while the student attends to frames 7 and 18. Even with similar outputs, their internal reasoning differs---problematic for temporal consistency when objects undergo appearance changes.

\paragraph{Cross-Attention Distribution Matching}
Let $q_i$ denote a query from the current frame. Both models compute attention over their memory banks:
\begin{align}
\alpha^S_i &= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q_i (K^S)^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right), \label{eq:attn_student}\\
\alpha^T_i &= \text{softmax}\left(\frac{q_i (K^T)^\top}{\sqrt{d}}\right), \label{eq:attn_teacher}
\end{align}
where $K^S$, $K^T$ are memory keys and $d$ is the key dimension. These distributions encode which past frames the model deems relevant.

We minimize their KL divergence:
\begin{equation}
\Lattn = \frac{1}{N_q} \sum_{i=1}^{N_q} \text{KL}(\alpha^S_i \| \alpha^T_i),
\label{eq:attn_loss}
\end{equation}
where $N_q$ is the number of queries. This teaches the student to focus on temporally similar frames as the teacher---crucial for consistent tracking.

\paragraph{Memory Readout Feature Matching}
After attention, models extract weighted features:
\begin{align}
r^S_i &= \sum_{j} \alpha^S_{ij} V^S_j, \label{eq:readout_student}\\
r^T_i &= \sum_{j} \alpha^T_{ij} V^T_j, \label{eq:readout_teacher}
\end{align}
where $V^S$, $V^T$ are memory values. These readouts represent aggregated temporal information.

We match these via L2 loss:
\begin{equation}
\Lread = \frac{1}{N_q} \sum_{i=1}^{N_q} \|r^S_i - r^T_i\|^2.
\label{eq:readout_loss}
\end{equation}

This ensures the student extracts similar semantic information from memory as the teacher. In ablations (Section~\ref{sec:ablation}), matching both attention and readouts proves essential---neither alone suffices.

\subsection{Learned Memory Pruning}
\label{sec:pruning}

Edge devices impose hard memory limits. A Jetson Nano has 4GB RAM total, shared with OS and other processes. We cannot store hundreds of frame features. Therefore, we train a gating network to select the most informative $B$ tokens.

\paragraph{Importance Scoring}
For each memory token $j$, we compute an importance score:
\begin{equation}
s_j = \text{MLP}_\theta([k_j; v_j; a_j; m_j; u_j]),
\label{eq:importance}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item $k_j, v_j \in \mathbb{R}^{256}$: key and value embeddings
\item $a_j \in \mathbb{R}$: age (frames since creation), normalized to [0,1]
\item $m_j \in \mathbb{R}$: optical flow magnitude at that location
\item $u_j \in \mathbb{R}$: mask prediction entropy (uncertainty)
\end{itemize}

The MLP has 2 hidden layers (128, 64 units) with ReLU activation, adding just ~50K parameters. It learns to identify informative memories: first frames (anchors), appearance changes (high motion/uncertainty), and recent frames (temporal smoothness).

\paragraph{Differentiable Selection}
Directly selecting top-$B$ tokens is non-differentiable. We use Gumbel-Softmax~\cite{jang2017gumbel} for approximate gradients:
\begin{equation}
g_j = s_j + \text{Gumbel}(0, 1), \quad \tilde{s}_j = \frac{\exp(g_j / \tau)}{\sum_{j'} \exp(g_{j'} / \tau)},
\label{eq:gumbel}
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is temperature, annealed from 1.0 to 0.1 during training. We select top-$B$ values of $\tilde{s}$ and zero-out others:
\begin{equation}
\text{mask}_j = \mathbb{1}[\tilde{s}_j \in \text{TopK}(\tilde{s}, B)].
\end{equation}

Pruned memory becomes $\tilde{K} = K \odot \text{mask}$, $\tilde{V} = V \odot \text{mask}$.

\paragraph{Budget Regularization}
To enforce the budget, we add:
\begin{equation}
\Lbudget = \max(0, \sum_j \text{mask}_j - B)^2 + \lambda_{\text{sparse}} \sum_j s_j,
\label{eq:budget_loss}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda_{\text{sparse}} = 0.01$. The first term penalizes exceeding $B$; the second encourages sparsity.

\subsection{Adaptive Inference}
\label{sec:adaptive}

Device capabilities vary (Jetson Nano vs. Orin) and fluctuate (thermal throttling, background load). Hard-coded configurations either underutilize fast devices or miss frame deadlines on slow ones. We implement a PID controller that adjusts two parameters online:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item \textbf{Resolution scale} $\rho \in [0.5, 1.0]$: Applied to input dimensions
\item \textbf{Memory window} $W \in [2, 8]$: Limits attention to recent $W$ frames plus anchors
\end{itemize}

The controller tracks processing time $t_\text{actual}$ against target $t_\text{target}$ (e.g., 33ms for 30 FPS):
\begin{align}
e_t &= t_\text{target} - t_\text{actual}, \\
\Delta\rho_t &= K_p e_t + K_i \sum_{\tau} e_\tau + K_d (e_t - e_{t-1}),
\label{eq:pid}
\end{align}
with gains $K_p=0.1$, $K_i=0.01$, $K_d=0.05$ (tuned empirically). We clip $|\Delta\rho| < 0.05$ to avoid jarring quality changes.

This simple mechanism maintains smooth frame rates across diverse hardware without manual tuning. In practice, the controller converges within 10-15 frames and handles dynamic load changes gracefully.

\subsection{Training Procedure}

We combine all losses:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \Lmask + \lambda_1 \Lattn + \lambda_2 \Lread + \lambda_3 \Ledge + \lambda_4 \Lbudget,
\label{eq:total_loss}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item $\Lmask = \text{IoU} + \text{BCE}$: standard mask supervision
\item $\Ledge = \|\nabla M^S - \nabla M^T\|^2$: edge-aware loss for sharp boundaries
\item Weights: $\lambda_1=1.0$, $\lambda_2=0.5$, $\lambda_3=0.3$, $\lambda_4=0.2$ (from validation)
\end{itemize}

Training proceeds in three stages:

\paragraph{Stage 1 (10 epochs): Foundation}
Train with full supervision on 8-frame clips. Memory gating disabled---use all tokens. Learning rate $10^{-4}$ with AdamW. Establishes basic feature representations.

\paragraph{Stage 2 (10 epochs): Memory Learning}
Enable memory pruning, increase to 24-frame clips. Gating network learns to select important tokens. Learning rate decays to $5 \times 10^{-5}$.

\paragraph{Stage 3 (5 epochs): Quantization-Aware Fine-tuning}
Simulate INT8 quantization (except attention layers at FP16). Learning rate $10^{-5}$. Minimizes accuracy loss during deployment.

We train on 4× A100 GPUs (40GB) for ~36 hours total. Batch size 8 clips per GPU. Data augmentation: random crop, flip, color jitter, motion blur.

This strategy outperforms FIFO and other heuristics.}

\textbf{Accuracy:} \model-Base achieves 84.5\% J\&F (97.7\% of teacher) with 16× fewer parameters. Even \model-Small reaches 83.1\% (96.1\% of teacher) with 48× fewer parameters---remarkable given the compression ratio.

\textbf{Comparison to MobileSAM:} Our temporal extension of MobileSAM (output-only distillation) achieves just 72.3\% J\&F. The 10.8-point improvement with \model-Small validates our memory-aware distillation approach---teaching temporal reasoning matters.

\textbf{Universal Real-Time:} \model-Tiny achieves real-time on all devices, including the resource-constrained Jetson Nano (4GB RAM, 128 CUDA cores). This enables applications like drone-based environmental monitoring or wearable health devices.

\textbf{Memory Efficiency:} XMem fails on Jetson Nano due to OOM. Our learned pruning keeps peak memory under 3.2GB (including model, activations, and memory bank)---leaving room for the operating system and other processes.

\textbf{Mobile Performance:} On iPhone 14 Pro (using CoreML), \model-Tiny processes frames in 19ms---fast enough for 50 FPS. This enables AR applications with smooth visual effects. The Android Pixel 7 Pro achieves 31ms with ONNX Runtime---just meeting 30 FPS.

\textbf{Adaptive Inference Impact:} With the PID controller enabled, devices automatically adjust to thermal throttling. For example, when iPhone 14 heats up after 5 minutes, the controller reduces resolution from 480p to 432p, maintaining 30 FPS. Without adaptation, frame rate drops to 22 FPS with stuttering.

\subsection{Long Video Stability}

A critical concern for memory-limited models is drift over extended sequences. Figure~\ref{fig:long_video} shows J\&F score evolution on 5-minute YouTube-VOS videos.

\textbf{Stability:} \model-Small maintains 82-83\% J\&F throughout, with just 1-2\% degradation. SAM2 (teacher) remains most stable at 86-87\%. Importantly, we outperform XMem (which has larger memory) after 3 minutes---evidence that \emph{selection quality} matters more than \emph{memory size}.

\textbf{Drift Comparison:} FIFO baseline (keep most recent 12 frames) starts at 80\% but degrades to 71\% by minute 5---10-point drop. Simple recency heuristics fail when objects undergo significant appearance changes early in the video---the model forgets those critical reference frames.

\textbf{Why Memory-Aware Distillation Helps:} By teaching the student \emph{which} frames the teacher attends to, we implicitly teach it which frames are worth remembering. The student learns that appearance change points (e.g., object rotations, occlusions) should be preserved even as they age, while static frames can be discarded.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Memory-Aware Distillation}
Removing attention matching ($\Lattn$) drops accuracy 2.9 points; removing readout matching ($\Lread$) costs 1.7 points. Removing both costs 4.5 points---indicating they provide complementary information. Output-only distillation (standard approach) achieves just 80.4\%---2.7 points below our method. This validates that teaching \emph{how to reason temporally} is crucial.

\paragraph{Learned Pruning}
Replacing learned pruning with FIFO (keep most recent 12 frames) drops 3.3 points. Random pruning is even worse at 74.2\%---10-point drop. This proves that intelligently selecting memories based on importance scores significantly outperforms simple heuristics.

\paragraph{Memory Budget}
Reducing budget to 128 tokens saves memory but costs 2.2 points. Increasing to 768 tokens gains just 0.3 points while slowing inference 22\% and using 50\% more RAM. The 384-token budget represents a sweet spot for edge devices.

\paragraph{Training from Scratch}
Without the teacher (random initialization), we achieve only 76.5\%---6.6 points below full \model. This highlights the value of distillation: the teacher's learned representations bootstrap the student effectively.

\paragraph{Adaptive Inference}
Removing the PID controller doesn't hurt accuracy (83.1\%) but reduces effective throughput to 24.3 FPS when devices face variable load. The controller trades tiny amounts of resolution for consistent frame rates---improving user experience.

Despite 48× fewer parameters, \model-Small produces visually similar masks to SAM2, with minor differences in edge sharpness and small detail preservation.}
\label{fig:qualitative}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:qualitative} shows example outputs. \model\ handles:

\textbf{Occlusions:} When the target object moves behind trees, the model retrieves early reference frames (via learned pruning) to maintain identity.

\textbf{Deformations:} Dancing person with articulated motion. The compact decoder successfully tracks despite pose changes.

\textbf{Similar Distractors:} Multiple faces---the model focuses on the correct target by attending to distinguishing features in past frames.

\textbf{Motion Blur:} Fast-moving ball. Performance degrades slightly (softer edges) but maintains tracking. The optical flow signal in the gating network helps retain motion-heavy frames.

\paragraph{Failure Cases}
We identify limitations:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item \textbf{Tiny objects} (< 32 pixels): Our 16×16 patches lack resolution. Using 8×8 patches would help but doubles computation.
\item \textbf{Transparent surfaces}: Glass, water reflection---edges are ambiguous even for humans. This remains an open challenge.
\item \textbf{Extreme occlusion} (> 90\% for > 2 seconds): If the object disappears completely, we lose tracking. Post-processing re-detection could help.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory Pruning Behavior Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:memory_behavior} visualizes which frames the gating network retains. The learned strategy:

\paragraph{Anchor Frames (Always Keep)}
First 1-2 frames serve as reference templates. Importance score $s_j$ remains high even as age increases. These provide canonical object appearance for long-term identity.

\paragraph{Appearance Changes (High Priority)}
Frames with large motion ($m_j > 0.7$) or high uncertainty ($u_j > 0.5$) get elevated scores. Examples: object rotations, lighting changes, occlusions. The model learns these are informative for disambiguating future frames.

\paragraph{Recent Context (Temporal Smoothness)}
Last 2-4 frames kept even if static. This ensures smooth transitions between predictions---prevents flickering.

\paragraph{Redundancy Removal}
Static frames with low motion and high confidence are aggressively pruned. For a static object over 10 frames, we might keep just 2-3, saving 70-80\% memory.

This strategy emerges from end-to-end training without explicit supervision---the model learns what's useful through the combined objective.

\label{fig:energy_pareto}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Energy-Efficiency Analysis}

Figure~\ref{fig:energy_pareto} shows the energy-accuracy Pareto frontier. Key insights:

\textbf{Pareto Dominance:} At every energy level, \model\ variants achieve higher accuracy than prior methods. For example, at 2.5 Wh, we get 84.5\% (Base) vs. 81.8\% (STM).

\textbf{Battery Impact:} \model-Tiny consumes 0.8 Wh per 10-minute video at 480p. A typical drone battery is 100 Wh, enabling 1,250 minutes (20+ hours) of continuous video analysis---transforming what's feasible for environmental monitoring, search and rescue, etc.

\textbf{Carbon Footprint:} Processing 1 hour of video on SAM2 (cloud) consumes ~213 Wh (at 35.6 Wh per 10 min). \model-Small consumes just 7.8 Wh---27× less. Across millions of hours of video (YouTube uploads 500 hours/minute), this represents significant energy savings.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Why Memory-Aware Distillation Works}

Video segmentation isn't just about predicting correct masks---it's about maintaining consistent object representations over time. By teaching the student \emph{how} the teacher uses memory (attention distributions, readout features), we transfer temporal reasoning strategy, not just outputs.

This yields three benefits:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item \textbf{Consistency:} Student attends to similar reference frames, improving stability
\item \textbf{Robustness:} Learns when to check earlier frames vs. recent observations
\item \textbf{Efficiency:} Implicitly learns which memories are worth preserving
\end{enumerate}

Our ablations confirm that matching \emph{both} attention and readouts is essential---neither alone suffices. This suggests future distillation for temporal models should consider internal reasoning, not just outputs.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

\paragraph{Resolution Constraints}
16×16 patches limit small object performance. Potential solutions: hierarchical patching (8×8 for high-motion regions), adaptive resolution per spatial region, or lightweight upsampling decoders.

\paragraph{Fixed Memory Budget}
Our budget (384 tokens for Small) is constant across videos. Simple scenes could use fewer; complex multi-object scenes might need more. Future work: predict optimal budget from scene complexity (object count, motion, etc.).

\paragraph{Temporal Horizon}
With 384 tokens over long videos, we may discard important early frames. Possible solutions: hierarchical memory (detailed recent, compressed distant), external memory banks, or re-identification mechanisms.

\paragraph{Domain Shift}
Performance degrades on out-of-distribution videos (underwater, thermal imaging, microscopy). While training data diversity helps, domain-specific fine-tuning may be necessary for specialized applications.

\paragraph{Hardware-Software Co-Design}
Our optimizations target existing hardware. Future edge devices could be designed with video segmentation in mind: specialized memory hierarchies, efficient attention accelerators, or online compression hardware.

\subsection{Broader Impacts}

\paragraph{Positive Applications}
\textbf{Privacy:} On-device processing prevents sensitive data (medical, personal) from leaving the device. \textbf{Accessibility:} Lower costs and internet requirements democratize AI for developing regions. \textbf{Sustainability:} Reduced energy consumption benefits the environment. \textbf{Real-time robotics:} Enables responsive autonomous systems.

\paragraph{Potential Misuse}
Like any computer vision technology, \model\ could be misused for unauthorized surveillance or tracking. We advocate for responsible deployment with appropriate consent and regulations. The efficiency improvements don't fundamentally change misuse potential---they mostly shift processing from cloud to edge.

\paragraph{Environmental Considerations}
While \model\ dramatically reduces inference energy (12× less than SAM2), training still requires significant computation (4× A100 for 36 hours ≈ 52 kWh). However, this one-time cost amortizes across millions of inferences. For context: processing 1,000 hours of video saves ~205 kWh vs. SAM2---recouping training energy after 250 hours of use.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented \model, enabling SAM2-quality video segmentation on edge devices through memory-aware knowledge distillation. Our approach teaches student models not just what to predict, but how to reason about temporal information---matching attention distributions and memory readouts with the teacher.

Key contributions:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=12pt,itemsep=2pt]
\item \textbf{Memory-aware distillation} that transfers temporal reasoning strategy, improving long-term tracking stability
\item \textbf{Learned memory pruning} with hard budget constraints, intelligently selecting informative frames while respecting device limits
\item \textbf{Adaptive inference} that automatically adjusts computation to maintain real-time performance across diverse hardware
\end{enumerate}

Results: 83.1\% J\&F on DAVIS 2017 (96\% of SAM2) with 48× fewer parameters, 6.5× faster inference, and 12× less energy. Real-time operation (20-35 ms/frame) on Jetson devices and smartphones enables entirely new application scenarios.

By releasing models and tools, we hope to accelerate research on efficient video understanding and enable privacy-preserving, low-latency applications on edge devices. Future work includes hierarchical memory architectures, adaptive budgets, and hardware-software co-design for next-generation edge AI.
